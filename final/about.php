<p style="width:70%"> Over this past year, I have spent much of my time looking at my bookshelf while working from home. My library is largely comprised of non-fiction and academic books relating to book history, art history, museum studies, and religious history. I rarely, if ever, purchase books from large booksellers like Amazon or Barnes and Noble. Instead my collection is sourced from used bookstores (I always try to go to at least one in every city I visit), Little Free Libraries and gifts from friends and family.</p>
